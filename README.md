## Launching Instructions
To begin using the application, the server must be launched before the client.
1. Type `./ftpServer <portnumber>` into the command line and specify the port number that server should use.
2. Type `./ftpClient <ipaddress> <portnumber>` and specify the port number and IP address of the server the client should connect to.
