## Compilation Instructions
- To build the client and server in one step, type `make` into the command line.
- The client and server can also be built individually by typing `make ftpServer` or `make ftpClient`

## Launching Instructions
To begin using the application, the server must be launched before the client.

1. Type `./ftpServer <portnumber>` into the command line and specify the port number that server should use.
2. Type `./ftpClient <ipaddress> <portnumber>` and specify the port number and IP address of the server the client should connect to.
